/**
 * Defines a marker interface for Data Transfer Objects (DTO).
 *
 * A DTO is a simple object that is designed to store data and transfer it between
 * different parts of the application or between layers. DTOs typically do not contain
 * business logic or behavior, and their primary responsibility is to encapsulate
 * and structure data for transmission.
 *
 * Classes implementing this interface are used for input or output operations
 * in the application, such as creating, updating, or retrieving entities
 * in the system. This interface provides a common contract for identifying these objects.
